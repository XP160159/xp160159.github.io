[Code Definitions](#code-definitions)

| Term | Definition | Base Structure / Syntax | Real Life Example | App Example |
|------|------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
|Variable| A named container used to store a value that may change. | `var x = 5;` |weight,bank,height|  |
|Constant| A fixed value that cannot change once set. | `const PI = 3.14;` |year you were born|  |
|Data Type| The kind of value a variable holds, like numbers or text. | `int`, `String`, `bool` |if you set everything to a video and tried to load a picture it would not work and the computer would see it as a video|  |
|String| A sequence of characters used to represent words or text. | `"Hello World"` |in games like username,time,quests,health|  |
|Interger| Whole number values. | `int age = 16;` |streak counts like in tik tok or doulingo|  |
|Double| Number values with decimals. | `double age = 16.2;` |more specific numbers for example a charcter in a game instead of whole numbers and being choppy more specific numbers is smoother|  |
|Boolean| A value that can be true or false. | `bool isLoggedIn = false;` |for example if have number of XP in a game and is true then a reward|  |
|List| A collection of values in a specific order. | `List<String> names = [];` |example like items in a game from strongest to oldest or newest to oldest|  |
|Null| A special value that means “nothing.” | `String? name = null;` |unloaded levels in a game is and example|  |
|Function| A reusable block of code that performs an action. | `void sayHi() { print("Hi"); }` |example walking animation in a game or jumping|  |
|Parameter| The information passed into a function to change how it works. | `greet(String name)` |checking ids for a rated R movie|  |
|Return| The result a function gives back. | `return total;` |what you get back for exmaple buying something you get what you buy or recipt|  |
|Scope| Where a variable or function can be used. | (No set syntax — concept-based) |for example using a subway card at subway it cant be used at tacobell|  |
|Class| Blueprint for creating objects with specific structure and behavior. | `class Dog {}` |paper has a specific structure and a specific behavior you can crumble it fold it etc it goes for everything|  |
|Object| A specific version of a class. | `Dog myDog = Dog();` |the object created from the class |  |
|Property| A variable that belongs to a class/object. | `String name;` |the name for a varible that belongs to a certain/class/object|  |
|Method| A function that belongs to a class. | `void bark() {}` |a resuable code like jump in a class(blueprint)|  |
|Constructor| A special function used to set up a class when it’s created. | `Dog(this.name);` |instructions before creating something creating a size,color for a water bottle|  |
|Abstraction| Hiding the inner workings of code so users only interact with what they need. | (Concept — not specific code) |a car in automatic you dont need to know how its working but makes things simplier|  |
|Override| Changing how a built-in or inherited function behaves. | `@override` |walk animation then you get hurt and overides into limping animation|  |
|Void| A function that does not return a value. | `void printMessage() {}` |giving a gift to someone not getting anything back ot turning on the lights theres an action turning them on but nothing returning|  |
